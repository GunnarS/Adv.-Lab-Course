\section{Preface}
The object of this experiment is the production of frequency doubled visible (blue) light by coupling infrared laser light into a nonlinear $KNbO_3$-crystal. We are supposed to analyse the dependency of the output power on several parameters and the wavelength of the second harmonic wave.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Diode laser}
A LASER (\emph{Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation}) amplifies as the name implies light by means of a resonator via stimulated emission. Principle constituents of all types of lasers are therefore an active medium which is converted into inversion thru pumping and a resonator. Nevertheless there are several diversified types of lasers. The typical construction of a diode laser is shown in figure \ref{fig:laser}. Due to its inexpensive production and its high efficiency (about $\unit[50]{\%}$) diode lasers are widely-used. Furthermore it operates within a long range of wavelengths ($\unit[550]{nm}$ to $\unit[60]{\mu m}$).
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/laser}
	\caption{Setup of a typical diode laser~\cite{demtroed}}
	\label{fig:laser}
\end{figure}
The active medium is represented by a biased p-n-junction. If a voltage is applied (see figure \ref{fig:pn} right), the electrons are able to reach the boundary layer and recombine with the holes. Thus a photon of an energy correlated with the gap energy is emitted.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/pn}
	\caption{p-n-junction of a diode laser without (left) and with (right) applied voltage~\cite{demtroed}}
	\label{fig:pn}
\end{figure}
As the semiconductor crystal has a high refraction index (i.\ e.\ $n_{\mathrm{GaAs}} = 3.6$) in comparison to air ($n_{\mathrm{air}} \approx 1$), the reflectivity of the boundary surface of the crystal amounts to $R=[(n_{\mathrm{GaAs}}-1)/(n_{\mathrm{GaAs}}+1)]^2 = 0.32$. This can be optimized by polishing those surfaces. Therefore the orthogonal boundary layers of the crystal can indeed be used as a resonator.

Of course it is neccessary to adjust the power of the laser. For this the diode current has to be varied. But one has to consider that a threshold current $I_{\mathrm{thr}}$ exists, because the photons can be absorbed or scattered in the resonator which results in an energyloss. Only above this threshold the laser enters the linear working regime and is pumped efficently.

\subsection{Gaussian Beams}
Because laser beams have a finite beam size, it is neccessary to go beyond the model of plane waves and introduce so-called \textsc{gaussian} beams (see figure \ref{fig:gaussianbeams}). In this theoretical approach the beam has a \textsc{gaussian} intensity distribution perpendicular to the wave vector $\vec{k}$. Furthermore it is characterized by its beam radius $w(z)$ and the \textsc{Rayleigh}-length $z_0 = \pi w^2_0/\lambda$. For $|z| \leq z_0$ the beam is focussed and has its smallest radius $w_0$ which is called waist at $z=0$. For $z \ll z_0$ nearly plane waves propagate and for large $z$ one observes spherical wavefronts. Furthermore the angle of divergence can be derived to $\theta_{\mathrm{div}} = w_0/z_0 = \lambda/\pi w_0$.
\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{graphics/gaussianbeams}
	\caption{Sketch of a \textsc{gaussian} beam~\cite{meschi}}
	\label{fig:gaussianbeams}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Birefringence}
\label{cha:bi}
If light propagates through an optical medium, the refraction index $n$ of this medium has to be considered. In addition crystals like $KNbO_3$ with anisotropic refraction indices because of anisotropic linkage forces exist. The symmetry axis (if there is one) of the crystal is called optical axis. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{graphics/brech}
	\caption{Walk off of the extraordinary beam~\cite{meschi}}
	\label{fig:brech}
\end{figure}
Due to this the polarisation $\vec{P}$ induced by the electromagnetic wave is not parallel to $\vec{E}$ anymore, which is explained thru the dielectric constant which turns into a three dimensional tensor. Therefore different polarized beams take different paths. The one which follows \textsc{Snellius'} law is called ordinary beam, while the other one experiencing a walk off (see also figure \ref{fig:brech}) is called extraordinary beam. Those beams have orthogonal polarisations. This effect of splitting an incoming beam is called birefringence and is used for example in $\lambda/2$-plates.


\subsection{Nonlinear Optics and Frequency Doubling}
The electrons of a crystal being exposed to electromagnetic waves are displaced from their position of rest. If these shifts are small, the restoring forces will depend linearly on the displacementamplitude, so indeed the \textsc{Hooke} law will apply. As a result the polarisation $\vec{P}$ is proportional to the present electric field $\vec{E}$. 

At high intensities of (coherent) light (i.\ e.\ laser light) though this approximation is not applicable anymore. Thereby higher orders of the \textsc{Taylor}-expansion of the polarisation also have to be considered. Assuming an isotropic medium $P_\mathrm{x} = \varepsilon_0 \left( \chi_1 E_\mathrm{x} + \chi_2 E^2_\mathrm{x} + \dots \right)$ holds for the x-component of the polarisation. Now one can insert the electric field of a monochromatic light wave and yields:
\begin{align}
P_\mathrm{x} &\approx \varepsilon_0 \left( \chi_1 E_0 \cos{\omega t} + \chi_2 E^2_0 \cos^2{\omega t} \right) \\
             &= \varepsilon_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \chi_2 E^2_0 + \chi_1 E_0 \cos{\omega t} + \frac{1}{2} \chi_2 E^2_0 \cos{2 \omega t} \right) \ \ldotp
\end{align}
So indeed one gets an oscillation term at twice of the original frequency and a constant polarisation term in addition to the one for the linear approximation. With correct phase relation those second harmonic oscillations can add up to a macroscopic wave. But in general the phases do not match due to dispersion at different frequencies. To obtain phase matching do the following considerations.

Assuming plane waves and constant intensity $I_\mathrm{f}$ of the fundamental wave within a crystal of length $L$ the output intensity of the second harmonic $I_\mathrm{sh}$ after the crystal is given by:
\begin{align}
I_{\mathrm{sh}}\propto \, L^2 I^2_{\mathrm{f}} \left( \frac{\sin{\Delta k \frac{L}{2}}}{\Delta k \frac{L}{2}} \right)^2 \ ,
\end{align}
whereas $\Delta k = k(2\omega) - 2 k(\omega) = \frac{2\omega}{v_\mathrm{sh}} - 2 \frac{\omega}{v_\mathrm{f}} = \frac{2\omega}{c} \left( n(2\omega) - n(\omega) \right)$ is the phase mismatch. At minimal mismatch the output intensity of the second harmonic reaches its maximum due to maximal constructive interference, therefore the phase matching condition reads:
\begin{align}
\Delta k = 0 \hspace{1cm} \Leftrightarrow \hspace{1cm} n(2\omega) = n(\omega) \ \ldotp
\end{align}
On account of that nonlinear crystals have to be used, because such a phase matching is not possible with normally dispersive media. Indeed there $n(2\omega) > n(\omega)$ always holds. In anisotropic crystals though the refractive index of the second harmonic can be lowered for example by using the second harmonic as the extraordinary beam.

For this the angle between the incident wave and the optical axis is adjusted such that the above condition holds. This method is called \emph{angle tuning}. But there is a problem with this approach. Of course as written in section \ref{cha:bi} the extraordinary beam experiences a walk off for $\theta \neq 0, \pi/2$. This is problematic because the beams should overlap behind the crystal to obtain an interference pattern. Therefore one uses \emph{temperature tuning}. This furthermore also allows a high conversion efficiency into the second harmonic, which improves the intensity.


\subsection{Coherence}
Coherence is a measure of the phase correlation of wavefronts. Two waves are called coherent, if roughly speaking their phase difference is constant within a relevant range. Indeed coherence is neccessary for interference. One distinguishes between time coherence and spatial coherence, but for means of brevity we will not discuss this further.

\subsection{Optical Grating}
A grating is used to create an interference pattern on a screen via illuminating it with coherent light. The maxima obtain the relation $\sin{\alpha} = n \lambda/g$, whereas $\alpha$ is the angle of diffraction of the maximum of $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ order, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light and $g$ the grating constant.

The spectral resolution of such a grating amounts to $\lambda/\Delta\lambda = N n$, where $N$ is the number of illuminated slits, so indeed one can improve the resolution by illuminating the grating properly.

\subsection{Michelson Interferometer}
The \textsc{Michelson} interferometer is a very common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{graphics/michelson}
	\caption{\textsc{Michelson} interferometer~\cite{demtroed2}}
	\label{fig:michelson}
\end{figure}
As depicted above the incoming beam hits a beam splitter, so one reflects off, propagates to the top mirror and then reflects back, goes through the semi-transparent mirror again and reaches the detector. The other beam first passes the beam splitter and hits the mirror on the right. It is then reflected back and reflects off the beam splitter into the detector. So both beams travel indeed along different paths. As the right mirror can be displaced on an optical bank one can change the distance $s_2$ and therefore change the relative path difference of the two beams. This results in a phase difference $\Delta \phi = 2\pi (s_1-s_2)/\lambda$.



\section{Experimentation and Analysis}
\subsection{Diode Laser and power measurements}\label{ana_laserpower}
To get familiar with the laser we first examine the laser power depencence on the input current. Therefore we put a gauged photodiode in front of the laser and record the laser power for different values of the input current. Do avoid the photodiode to leave its 'linear range' we put an attenuator in front of it. The measured values are displayed in table \ref{tab:ana_laserpower_att} in the appendix. In order to gauge the attenuator we also recorded some values in the range between threshold current and an output of $\unit[50]{\mu W}$ without using the attenuator. These values are displayed in table \ref{tab:ana_laserpower_woatt} in the appendix.

Figure \ref{fig:ana_laser_watt} and \ref{fig:ana_laser_woatt} show plots of laser power with and without the attenuator as well as linear fits to the data taken above the threshold current. The fit results read:
\begin{align}
P_\textrm{att}(I) &= b_\textrm{att} + m_\textrm{att} \,\cdotp\, I = \unit[(-33.8 \pm 0.14)]{\mu W} + \unit[(0.574 \pm 0.002
)]{\frac{\mu W}{mA}}\,\cdotp\, I\\
P_\textrm{real}(I) &= b_\textrm{real} + m_\textrm{real} \,\cdotp\, I =\unit[(-36 \pm 1.5)]{mW} + \unit[(0.60 \pm 0.02
)]{\frac{mW}{mA}}\,\cdotp\, I
\end{align}
The ratio of the gradients yields the attenuation:
\begin{align}
\alpha = \unit[(1049 \pm 36)]{}
\end{align}
where the error is calculated via
\begin{align*}
\Delta \alpha = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta m_\textrm{att}}{m_\textrm{real}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m_\textrm{att}}{m^2_\textrm{real}}\Delta m_\textrm{real}\right)^2}
\end{align*}
\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Real laser output power versus input current and corresponding linear fit}
	\label{fig:ana_laser_woatt}
}
\end{floatrow}
\end{figure}
With this value we can determine the dependency of the laser power on the input current:
\begin{align}
P(I) &= b + m\,\cdotp\, I=\unit[(-3.6 \pm 0.1)\cdotp 10^{4}]{\mu W} + \unit[(602 \pm 21)]{\frac{\mu W}{mA}}\,\cdotp\, I
\end{align}
and we can deduce the threshold current:
\begin{align}
I_\textrm{thr} = -\frac{b}{m} = \unit[(59 \pm 3)]{mA}
\end{align}
where the error is given by:
\begin{align}
\Delta I_\textrm{thr} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta b}{m}\right)^2+\left(\frac{b}{m^2}\Delta m\right)^2}
\end{align}
The quantum efficiency $\eta$, which is defined as the number of emitted photons per electron injected in the laser diode, can be deduced using:
\begin{align}
P = \frac{h\nu N_\gamma}{t}\hspace{1cm} I = \frac{eN_\textrm{e}}{t}
\end{align}
where $N_\gamma$ and $N_\textrm{e}$ are the number of photons emitted and the number of electrons injected in the time intervall $t$ respectively. With the wavelength of the laser $\lambda = \unit[987]{nm}$ we get:
\begin{align}
\eta = \frac{N_\gamma}{N_\textrm{e}} = \frac{eP}{Ih\nu} \approx \frac{\partial P}{\partial I}\frac{e\lambda}{hc} = m\frac{e\lambda}{hc} = \unit[(0,48 \pm 0,02)]{}
\end{align}
with the error
\begin{align}
\Delta \eta = \frac{e\lambda}{hc}\Delta m
\end{align}
\subsection{Calibration of the variable attenuator}\label{subsec:var_att_calib}
To realize a variable attenuator, we place a rotatable $\lambda /2$ plate and a polarization filter between the laser and the photodiode. The scale of the $\lambda /2$ plate faces towards the laser and the angle of the analyzer is set to 90°. The polarization filter is then used as an analyzer whose transmitted intensity is given by the Malus law:
\begin{align*}
I(\alpha)=I_0\cdot\cos^2(\alpha)
\end{align*}
where $I_0$ is the intensity of the laser and $\alpha$ is given by the angle between the polarization axis of the beam and the polarizer. Because the polarizer is aligned colinear to the polarization axis of the beam and a $\lambda /2$ plate rotates the polarization axis of the beam by $2\Phi$, with $\Phi$ being the angle between the optical axis of the $\lambda /2$ plate and the beam polarization axis, we expect the following intensity behind the polarizer:
\begin{align*}
I(\Phi)=I_0\cdot\cos^2(2\Phi)
\end{align*}
Our data is presented in table \ref{tab:ana_var_att} in the appendix. Figure \ref{fig:ana_var_att} shows the data with the corresponding fit. The graph shows only the attenuated power because these value's error is smaller since it does not depend on the error containing attenuation of the fixed attenuator. The fit parameters read:
\begin{align*}
P_\textrm{attenuated} = \unit[(117.9 \pm 0.6)]{\mu W}\,\cdotp\,\cos^2\left(\unit[(2.0029 \pm 0.0009)]{\frac{1}{°}} \,\cdotp\, \Phi\right)\textrm{.}
\end{align*}
Therefore the transmitted power of the variable attenuator is:
\begin{align}
P = \unit[(124 \pm 4)]{mW}\,\cdotp\,\cos^2\left(\unit[(2.0029 \pm 0.0009)]{\frac{1}{°}} \,\cdotp\, \Phi\right)\textrm{,}
\end{align}
where the error of the amplitude is given by
\begin{align}
\Delta P_0 = \sqrt{\left(P_0^\textrm{attenuated}\Delta \alpha\right)^2+\left(\alpha\Delta P_0^\textrm{attenuated}\right)^2}\textrm{.}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{
   % \input{graphics/ana_var_att.tex}
}
  \caption{Transmission of the variable attenuator}
  \label{fig:ana_var_att}
\end{figure}
To calculate the extinction ratio we determine the minimal and maximal values of the (attenuated) transmitted power. The values are given in table \ref{tab:ana_extinction}. For the error weighted mean values calculated via:
\begin{align*}
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^N \frac{X_i}{(\Delta X_i)^2}}{\sum_{i=0}^N \frac{1}{(\Delta X_i)^2}}\hspace{2cm} \Delta \bar{X} = \frac{N}{\sum_{i=0}^N \frac{1}{(\Delta X_i)^2}}
\end{align*}
we get:
\begin{align*}
P_\textrm{max}^\textrm{att}&=\unit[(118 \pm 1)]{\mu W}\\
P_\textrm{min}^\textrm{att}&=\unit[(0.51 \pm 0.01)]{\mu W}\textrm{.}
\end{align*}
So the extinction ratio is given by
\begin{align}
\Gamma=\frac{P_\textrm{max}^\textrm{att}}{P_\textrm{min}^\textrm{att}}=\unit[(229 \pm 5)]{}\textrm{,}
\end{align}
with the error
\begin{align*}
\Delta\Gamma=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta P_\textrm{max}^\textrm{att}}{P_\textrm{min}^\textrm{att}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{ P_\textrm{max}^\textrm{att}}{\left(P_\textrm{min}^\textrm{att}\right)^2}\Delta P_\textrm{min}^\textrm{att}\right)^2}\textrm{.}
\end{align*}
