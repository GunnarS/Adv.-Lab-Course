\section{Preface}
The object of this experiment is the measurement of the positron-lifetime in metals, indium in this case, and insulators (here: acrylic glas). We are also supposed to show the existence of positronium in acrylic glas. In addition the average lifetime of positrons in indium is determined with respect to temperature and the vacancy formation enthalpy is identified due to the trapping model.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Positrons and Electrons}\label{subsec:th_positrons}
The positron $e^+$ is the antiparticle of the electron $e^-$, so they have the same quantum numbers (e.\ g.\ spin $1/2$) excepting electric charge ($\unit[\pm]{e}$). They are leptons and have a mass of $m_{\mathrm{e}} = \unit[511]{keV}$.

Positrons are created via pair production or as it is the case in the present experimental set-up via $\beta^+$-decay in atomic nuclei:
\begin{align*}
p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_\mathrm{e}
\end{align*}
If one injects a positron of some hundred $\unit{keV}$ into a solid state body, it will get thermalised due to \text{Coulomb}-scattering within a few picoseconds. The thermalised positron then diffuses through the solid until it annihilates with an electron. This produces $\gamma$-rays with an energy of $2 m_{\mathrm{e}}$. Due to conservation of total angular momentum and because photons are spin-one-bosons there will basically occur two processes. If the electron and positron have parallel spin, they will add to a total spin of $1$ (if $\hbar$ is set to $1$). This leads to an odd number of photons. Concerning momentum conservation at least three photons have to be created (higher number processes are suppressed and are therefore dropped). So in this case we indeed will observe a continuous $\gamma$ spectrum. If the electron and positron have antiparallel spin, total spin adds up to $0$. Now there will be two photons with an energy of $\unit[511]{keV}$ flying appart with an angle of $\unit[180]{^{\circ}}$. Because of the possibility of slightly different kinetic energies of the two fermions a small additional statistical angular distribution occurs.

In an insulator it is also possible that an electron and a positron form a bound state called positronium (similar to hydrogen-atom). This is not the case in a metall, because there the electron density is too high. Depending on the spin orientation there are ortho-positronium $1^3\mathrm{S}_1$ (total spin of $1$) and para-positronium $1^1\mathrm{S}_0$ (total spin of $0$). Due to vanishing angular momentum the ground state is not stable. Ortho-Positronium annihilates within $\unit[142]{ps}$ and para-positronium within $\unit[125]{ps}$. Because the first one decays via the suppressed (by a factor of $370$) three-photon-decay, its lifetime is longer. So in the present experimental set-up it is not possible to measure ortho-positronium, because a $\unit[511]{keV}$-photon is used to stop the measurement.

\subsection{The Trapping Model}
If there are lattice defects in the solid like in the present case, the injected positrons will mostly be captured in such lattice defects, because the electron density at the vacancy indeed is reduced as the electrons increase distances to each other on account of the missing atomic core. Due to being captured in such a lattice defect the positrons gain lifetime since only electrons of the conduction band are able to annihilate with them (see also figure \ref{fig:haftstellenmodell}).
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/haftstellenmodell}
  \caption{Illustration of the trapping model~\cite{skript}, modified}
  \label{fig:haftstellenmodell}
\end{figure}
As it is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:haftstellenmodell} injected positrons can be free or are bound in a vacancy. In both cases they can annihilate as written above (at a rate $\lambda_{\mathrm{f}}$ or $\lambda_{\mathrm{v}}$). Furthermore free positrons are captured at a rate $\mu_{\mathrm{v}}$ and bounded ones are liberated at a rate $\xi_{\mathrm{v}}$, whereas $\mu_{\mathrm{v}} > \xi_{\mathrm{v}}$. Based on those considerations one can write down rate equations
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d} n_{\mathrm{f}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &=  N - \lambda_{\mathrm{f}} n_{\mathrm{f}} - \mu_{\mathrm{v}} c_{\mathrm{L}} n_{\mathrm{f}} + \xi_v n_{\mathrm{v}} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} n_{\mathrm{v}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &=  - \lambda_{\mathrm{v}} n_{\mathrm{v}} + \mu_{\mathrm{v}} c_{\mathrm{L}} n_{\mathrm{f}} + \xi_v n_{\mathrm{v}}
\end{align}
for free and bound positrons in a solid state body. In thermal equilibrium the rates are equal and one can derive a relation for the average lifetime $\bar{\tau}$:
\begin{align}
\bar{\tau} = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{v}} + \mu_{\mathrm{v}} k(S) \exp{(H_{\mathrm{v}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{v}} \lambda_{\mathrm{f}} + \mu_{\mathrm{v}} k(S) \exp{(H_{\mathrm{v}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)}} \ldotp
\end{align}
Thereby $k(S)$ is a factor which depends on the entropy and $H_{\mathrm{v}}$ is the vacancy formation enthalpy. The latter describes the required energy for creation of lattice defects. In the rate equations also a factor $c_{\mathrm{L}}$ appeared. This is the so-called lattice defects concentration which is given by $c_{\mathrm{L}} = k(S)\, \exp{(H_{\mathrm{v}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)}$. So the number of lattice defects depends on the temperature, while the lifetime of the positrons depends on the number of vacancies as described before. Thus the average lifetime of positrons indeed depends on the temperature (see also figure \ref{fig:skurve}).
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/skurve}
  \caption{Average lifetime of positrons in a solid with respect to temperature}
  \label{fig:skurve}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:skurve} demonstrates that the mean lifetime follows an s-curve with asymptotes $\tau_{\mathrm{v}} = 1/\lambda_{\mathrm{v}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{f}} = 1/\lambda_{\mathrm{f}}$.

\subsection{Sodium}
\label{cha:na}
To measure the lifetime of positron we need signals which start and stop the measurement. In the present experimental configuration \Na decays with a half-life of $\unit[2.6]{y}$ and a probability of $\unit[99]{\%}$ into the excited $2+$-state of \Ne via emission of a positron.
\begin{align*}
  \Na \rightarrow \Ne + e^+ + \nu_e
\end{align*}
We then use the detection of the $\unit[1245]{keV}$ line of excited \Ne into its groundstate as a starting signal (see also figure \ref{fig:natrium}). That is appropriate, because the excited \Ne state has a very short lifetime (approximately $\unit[10]{ps}$, while we expect a positron-lifetime of some nanoseconds). So one can argue that the moment of emission of the photon is indeed also the moment of the positron-creation.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/natrium}
  \caption{Decay of \Na~\cite{skript}}
  \label{fig:natrium}
\end{figure}
If a positron annihilates, two $\unit[511]{keV}$-photons are created. The detection of one of these stops the measurement.

\section{Experimental Set-Up}
The experimental set-up is given by a "fast-slow-coincidencecircle", which is familiar on account of the nuclear-electronics-experiment (P525). Therefore we will just recall the important aspects here and drop the details (illustrations of the experimental set-up can be found in the next chapter).

\subsubsection*{Scintillation Detector and Photomuliplier}
As mentioned above we are supposed to detect photons (start and stop signals). This is carried out by two $\mathrm{BaF}_2$-scintillators. Via disexcitation of exitons at doping-atoms light is generated and then guided by the silvering of the crystal to a photomultiplier, which detects it (amplification via dynodes). There are two outputs: The so-called "fast-output" is used for time measurements, because it possesses a high time resolution. The "slow-output" is characterised by a high energy resolution and is hence applied for energy measurements.

\subsubsection*{Slow-Circle}
Because of its better energy resolution, the slow-circle is used to select specified signals in the experiment. For this the output of the photomultiplier is first of all amplified and then supplied to the single channel analyser (SCA). This constituent of the set-up offers the possibility to choose a energy range to just detect signals within a specified energy interval.

The signals of both SCAs then attain a coincidence unit. If both signals coincide, that means that they arrived within a defined time interval, a logical 'true' is returned. If everything is aligned properly, this implies that the desired event took place. The coincidence signal ('true' or 'false') is applied to the gate of the so-called multi channel analyser (MCA). Only if the gate is set 'true', the value of the fast-circle will be saved.

\subsubsection*{Fast-Circle}
The fast-circle is used to measure a time difference (between two signals). To achieve this the fast-outputs of the photomultipliers are applied to constant friction discriminators (CFD). They provide the start and stop signals for the following time to amplitude converter (TAC). To adjust the experimental set-up a delay unit is implemented between CFD and TAC. The TAC returns a voltage proportional to a time difference (given by start and stop signal) by charging a capacitor. This voltage is used as the MCA's direct input. If the gate is set 'true', the value will be saved.

\section{Experimentation and Analysis}
\subsection{Spectra}\label{subsec:ana_spectra}
First, we want to record the \Na spectrum with both scintillation detectors. In order to do this we set up the experiment as shown in figure \ref{fig:setup_prompt}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.4\textwidth}{!}{
    \includegraphics{graphics/setup_prompt}
}
  \caption{Set up for measuring the spectra and performing the adjustment for prompt curve measurement and the time calibration. This set up is used for each detector separately. '*' marks the position of an additional delay. \cite{skript}}
  \label{fig:setup_prompt}
\end{figure}
Before measuring the spectra we connect the SCA's and the amplifier's output to an oscilloscope to check if the amplifier's signal is inside the gate signal. For adjustment we use the delay placed at '*'. The spectrum measured with the left detector is shown in figure \ref{fig:ana_spectrum_left}.
\begin{figure}[H]
%\begin{floatrow}
%\ffigbox[0.5\textwidth]{}
%{
%\resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{
	\input{graphics/ana_spectrum_left}
%}
	\caption{\Na spectrum recorded with the left detector. The left peak is a \textsc{Compton}-back-scattering-peak, with increasing energy the $\unit[511]{keV}$ Peak and the 1275keV \Na peak are displayed.}
	\label{fig:ana_spectrum_left}
%}
%\ffigbox[0.5\textwidth]{}
%{
%\resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{
%%	\input{graphics/ana_spectrum_right}
%}
%	\caption{\Na spectrum recorded with the right detector.}
%	\label{fig:ana_spectrum_right}
%}
%\end{floatrow}
\end{figure}
The spectrum of the right detector looks in principle the same. Just the \textsc{Compton}-back-scattering-peak in the left of the spectrum is cut off at low energies and the global count rate is lower than that of the left detector. Unfortunately we forgot to save this spectrum so we aren't able to present it here. The 511keV peak is completely present and looks similar to the one of the left detector, so it is appropriate to use this detector for the stopping signal later.
\subsection{Prompt curve and time calibration}
\label{subsec:ana_time}
To measure a prompt curve and do the time calibration we use the fact that the two $\unit[511]{keV}$-photons are emitted at the same time. We set up both SCA windows to the $\unit[511]{keV}$-line and check their simultaneousness using the oscilloscope. A small time difference of the signals, caused e.g. by different cable lengths, can be levelled using the SCA's built-in delays. Now we set up the experiment as shown in figure \ref{fig:setup_time} and check the outputs of the coincidence and the TAC for simultaneousness with an oscilloscope. To level a small time difference we put a delay between TAC and oscilloscope. Now we use the same cables to connect the coincidence unit and the TAC to the MCA, because a change of cable length could destroy the simultaneousness of the signals because of an additional delay.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.4\textwidth}{!}{
    \includegraphics{graphics/setup_time}
}
  \caption{Set-up for measuring the prompt curve and the time calibration. \cite{skript}}
  \label{fig:setup_time}
\end{figure}
We set the delay between one CFD and the TAC to $\unit[12]{ns}$ and record the prompt curve displayed in figure \ref{fig:ana_prompt}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{graphics/ana_prompt.tex}
}
  \caption{Recorded prompt curve with \textsc{Gauss}-fit}
  \label{fig:ana_prompt}
\end{figure}
In order to be able to interprete the channel numbers of the MCA as time values for the lifetime measurements we need a time calibration. We record several prompt curves with different delays between one of the CFDs and the TAC. The curves, recorded in steps of \unit[4]{ns} starting at $\unit[4]{ns}$, are shown in figure \ref{fig:ana_timegauge}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{graphics/ana_timegauge.tex}
}
  \caption{Prompt curves for different delay times (in steps of $\unit[4]{ns}$ starting at $\unit[4]{ns}$)}
  \label{fig:ana_timegauge}
\end{figure}
To get a time calibration we fit \textsc{Gauss}-curves of the form $y_0 +\frac{A}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Delta x}\cdotp\exp\left\{-2\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{\Delta x}\right\}
$ curves to each prompt curve. In principle the prompt curves should be very sharp peaks, but are convoluted with a gaussian resolution function of the detector setup. The results are summarized in table \ref{tab:ana_timecalib} and drawn in figure \ref{fig:ana_timegaugefit}.
\begin{table}[H]

  \caption{Prompt curve peak positions versus delay time.}

\end{figure}
To eventually get a time calibration we fit a straight line to the obtained graph. The result reads:
\begin{align}
t = \unit[(-4.80 \pm 0.04)]{ns} + \unit[(6.414 \pm 0.008)]{ps} \, \cdotp \textrm{Channel}
\end{align}
With this time calibration we are now able to determine the time resolution of our setup by analyzing the prompt curve's width. From the \textsc{Gauss}-fit on the data shown in figure \ref{fig:ana_prompt} we get: 
\begin{align}
\textrm{FWHM} = \unit[(1,298 \pm 0.006)]{ns}
\end{align}
\subsection{Lifetime measurement in indium}\label{subsec:ana_indium}
Now we want to measure the positron lifetime in indium. We set up the experiment as shown in figure \ref{fig:setup_lifetime}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.4\textwidth}{!}{
    \includegraphics{graphics/setup_lifetime}
}
  \caption{Set up for measuring lifetime curves.\cite{skript}}
  \label{fig:setup_lifetime}
\end{figure}
We adjust the left SCA to accept every event above the $\unit[511]{keV}$-peak, because all these events originate from the $\unit[1275]{keV}$-photon of the decay of \Ne. So the left detector yields the start signal for the TAC. The right SCA stays unchanged and accepts every event in the $\unit[511]{keV}$-peak. The right detector therefore yields the stop signal for the TAC. Again we check the signals of coincidence unit and TAC for simultaneousness with an oscilloscope.

The indium probe is located between the two detectors and can be heated by the use of a soldering iron. In order to measure the temperature dependency of the positron lifetime we take lifetime curves for different values for the temperature. The curves are displayed in figures \ref{fig:ana_Indium_RT} to \ref{fig:ana_Indium_122} in the appendix. The form of the curves is again given by the convolution of an exponential lifetime distribution with a gaussian function respecting detector effects. We fit exponential functions of the form $f(x)=y_0 + A \cdotp \exp\left(-\frac{x-x_0}{t}\right)$ to the right, sloping, flanks of the curves. The fit results for $t$ and the corresponding time constants are summarized in table \ref{tab:ana_indium}. The plot of time constant versus temperature is displayed in figure \ref{fig:ana_TemperatureTau}.

  \end{tabular}
}
\caption{Fit results and time constants $\bar{\tau}$ for the indium curves}
  \label{tab:ana_indium}
\end{table}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{graphics/ana_TemperatureTau.tex}
}
  \caption{Time constant $\bar{\tau}$ versus indium temperature with \textsc{Boltzmann}-fit}
  \label{fig:ana_TemperatureTau}
\end{figure}
The plot shows the expected s-curve form. Fitting a \textsc{Boltzmann}-curve of the form $f(x) = y_0 + \frac{A}{1+\exp\left(-B\cdotp(x-x_0)\right)}$ to the data we can determine the lifetimes of bound and free positrons. The results read:
\begin{align}
\tau_\textrm{f} = \unit[(421 \pm 17)]{ps}\\
\tau_\textrm{f} = \unit[(522 \pm 28)]{ps}
\end{align}
The relatively big errors are conditional on the wideness of the s-curve and the lack of data in the regions of little pitch. 

To obtain the vacancy formation enthalpy we plot $\ln\left(\frac{1-\bar{\tau}/\tau_\mathrm{f}}{\bar{\tau}-\tau_\mathrm{b}}\right)$ versus the inverse temperature and perform a linear fit to the graph. The plot is shown in figure \ref{fig:ana_enthalpy}. The linear fit yields:
\begin{align}
\ln\left(\frac{1-\bar{\tau}/\tau_\mathrm{f}}{\bar{\tau}-\tau_\mathrm{b}}\right) = \unit[(10.2 \pm 0.4)]{} + \unit[(-5394 \pm 145)]{K}\,\cdotp\,\frac{1}{T}
\end{align}
So eventually the vacancy formation enthalpy is given by:
\begin{align}
H_\textrm{vac} = \unit[(0.47 \pm 0.01)]{eV}
\end{align}
This value is in accordance with the value given in~\cite{paper}:
\begin{align}
H_\textrm{vac}^{lit} = \unit[(0.54 \pm 0.03)]{eV}
\end{align}
The error of our value seems to be significantly to small. A reason for this might be that the relatively large freedom in choosing the fit ranges for the lifetime curves, which significantly changes the obtained values, is not respected by the stated error.

\subsection{Lifetime measurement in Acrylic Glas}
\label{subsec:ana_plexiglas}
To determine the positron lifetime in acrylic glas we use the same setup as in the case of indium. To get a sufficient number of events the measurement is done overnight. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{
    \input{graphics/ana_plexiglas_log.tex}
}
  \caption{Logarithmic plot of the measured positron lifetime spectrum in indium}
  \label{fig:ana_plexiglas_log}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:ana_plexiglas_log} the obtained spectrum is displayed logarithmically. One clearly sees the different lifetimes of bound and free positrons. To obtain the two lifetime values we first fit an exponential function to the part of the curve belonging to the positronium lifetime, subtract it and then fit another exponential function to the remaining curve. The curves and corresponding fits are displayed in figures \ref{fig:ana_plexiglas_long} and \ref{fig:ana_plexiglas_short}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{floatrow}
\ffigbox[0.5\textwidth]{}
{
\resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{
	\input{graphics/ana_plexiglas_long}

{

	\input{graphics/ana_plexiglas_short}

	\caption{Fit to the "short" part of the lifetime curve for positrons in acrylic glas after subtraction of the "long" part}
	\label{fig:ana_plexiglas_short}
}
\end{floatrow}
\end{figure}
The fits yield the following values for the positron lifetime in acrylic glas:
\begin{align}
\tau_\textrm{s} = \unit[(456.7 \pm 1.5)]{ps}\\
\tau_\textrm{l} = \unit[(1.85 \pm 0.02)]{ns}
\end{align}
We could not find any values in literature to compare the obtained values to. At least it seems to be reasonable that the lifetime of bound positronium states is much bigger than the lifetime of "free" positrons in the crystal. Thus we identify the smaller value with the lifetime due to the decay of free or captured positrons in the solid and the higher one with the lifetime of para-positronium. The positronium lifetime measured here is much bigger than the one stated in section \ref{subsec:th_positrons}. We assume this to be caused by interactions, such as impacts, between the positronium and the solid state crystal, which can e.g. excite the positronium to a higher state with longer lifetime.

\section{Abstract}
The s-curve behaviour of the positron lifetime in dependence on temperature was reproduced. The lifetimes of bound and free positrons are $\tau_\textrm{f} = \unit[(421 \pm 17)]{ps}$ and $\tau_\textrm{f} = \unit[(522 \pm 28)]{ps}$. The relatively big errors are conditional on the wideness of the s-curve and the lack of data in the regions of little pitch. 

The vacancy formation enthalpy has been determined to be $H_\textrm{vac} = \unit[(0.47 \pm 0.01)]{eV}$, which matches with the literature value of $H_\textrm{vac}^{lit} = \unit[(0.54 \pm 0.03)]{eV}$~\cite{paper}. Nevertheless the error of our value seems to be significantly to small. A reason for this might be that the relatively large freedom in choosing the fit ranges for the lifetime curves, which significantly changes the obtained values, is not respected by the stated error.

The measured lifetime of free and captured positrons in acrylic glas is $\tau_\textrm{s} = \unit[(456.7 \pm 1.5)]{ps}$ and the positronium lifetime amounts to $\tau_\textrm{l} = \unit[(1.85 \pm 0.02)]{ns}$.
